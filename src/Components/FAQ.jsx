                How is IoT technology different than the pre-existing PLC/DDC
                technologies ?
              </b>
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              IoT technology is like the cool, hip teenager of the tech world,
              while SCADA and PLC are like the reliable, dependable adults. IoT
              can connect to all your smart devices, and give you real-time
              insights and control from anywhere, while SCADA and PLC are more
              focused on specific industrial control and automation tasks. Think
              of IoT like having a personal assistant that can do everything for
              you, while SCADA and PLC are more like having a trusty tool belt
              for specific jobs. In short, IoT is like having a smartphone and
              SCADA/PLC is like having a landline. Both get the job done, but
              one is more versatile and convenient.

                <b>Do your systems need a power supply?</b>
              </Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>Our IoT device can be powered through different power supply sources. These include: </p>
                <p>1. AC power supply - This is a reliable and consistent power source that can be used to power the device. However, it requires access to an electrical outlet, which may not always be available</p>
                <p>2. Solar power - This is a great option for remote or off-grid locations where access to electricity is limited. The device can be powered using solar panels, which can be installed on the site to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity.</p>
                <p>3. Battery - This is a portable and flexible power source that can be used for temporary installations or where power outages are common. The battery can be charged using AC power or solar power, and it can keep the device running even when there is no access to power.</p>
                <p>The choice of power supply source will depend on the client's budget, device communication frequency, power consumption (For example, automation of a water pump requires an AC power source), site conditions, and other factors. We work with our clients to determine the best power supply option for their specific needs. </p>

                <b>Can you help connect my existing sensors to the internet?</b>
              </Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>Yes, we can connect your existing sensors to the internet, and showcase all data generated by them through web and mobile apps. Our IoT controller can interface with a wide range of sensors, including those that use analog, digital, or serial communication protocols. We have the capability to receive communication data from your sensors using different communication protocols such as RS 485, UART, 4-20mA, RS232, I2C, and others.</p>
                <p>By upgrading your sensors with the latest communication technologies, you will be able to access the sensor data remotely through mobile apps, analyze historical sensor values, take real-time operational decisions based on sensor conditions, get alerts based on pre-set conditions, as well as view all your assets on a map view.</p>

              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>The application will track the desired water-related KPIs for your facility, including storage levels, water quality levels, leaks detected, service requests etc., analyse historic consumption, and help understand usage patterns. We also help you better visualize your infrastructure by geotagging all assets on a map, as well as on the project layout.</p>
                <p>The system will generate alerts in case of problems in your water grid, including, detection of contaminants, leakages, and malfunctioning equipment. This allows users to stay informed and take proactive measures to address any issues with their water supply. Custom alerts and information can also be integrated as per the client requirement.</p>
                <p>All the information generated can be restricted and customized for different hierarchical access levels within your organization. We can also create custom dashboards to cater to your specific needs.</p>

              </Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>We know that water distribution systems will be exposed to tough environmental conditions. That's why we've designed our sensors to be water resistant, so you can be confident they'll perform even in challenging circumstances.</p>
                <p>We offer sensors with different ratings of water resistance, from IP65 to IP68. IP65 rated sensors can handle low pressure water jets from any direction; while IP68 rated sensors can even withstand long periods of immersion under pressure. We work with you to determine the best level of water resistance for your specific application, taking into account factors such as where the sensors will be located, the weather conditions they'll face, and the type of sensor being used.</p>
                <p>Our devices can withstand harsh environmental conditions like water ingress, dust ingress, high temperatures, altitude, and more. You can trust that they'll provide reliable and accurate data about your water distribution system, no matter what challenges come their way.</p>
